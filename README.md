### Start a local jupyter environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888
```

> Note: You need to have `python3` installed on your current runtime, which preferably should be a Linux distribution.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure that you move previous output files out of the way before you generate any further ones in order to avoid data loss!
